# PiHPSDR-Controller-V.5_inch
I have done a new layout of PiHPSDR Controller V2 using a 5 inch capacitive LCD display. It has the same interface as the original 7 inch display (not HDMI) It can be installed in a Hammond extruded enclosure type 1455Q2202BK. I am looking for another enclosure that can be used to make a complete transceiver in the same box using Hermes/ Orion MK2 or Oddysevs MK2 together with a PA and LPF/HPF and ATU.
There are 2 versions of the schematics and Gerber files. The latest version is with the possibility to use the Chineese rotary encoder (or the HRPG-ASCA#) I strongly advice to use the Chineese one!
